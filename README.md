# ConceptV1
My first Pygame game, work in progress

In order to use the map generators:
  You got to change the location in the Pyhton code of the CSV files. Currently its my own C Drive.
  Simply change r"C:\........\Concept V1\map\map_Entities.csv" to whatever your location is. It should work fine then. Apply this to all of the generators.
  
 The animations aren't as smooth as I would like and I turned off the eterna struggle of dying. Simply uncomment the "check_death" function in the player code and you should be able to die.
 
 Have fun!
